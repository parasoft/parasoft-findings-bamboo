# Parasoft Findings Plugin for Bamboo

The Parasoft Findings Plugin enables you to visualize test results generated by Parasoft products in Bamboo. It includes two tasks that convert Parasoft's XML reports into graphs so you can conveniently view the test details.

The Parasoft Findings Plugin provides the following tasks in Bamboo:
* Parasoft SOAtest 9.x Report Parser
* Parasoft Analyzers 10.x Report Parser


## Requirements

* Bamboo version 5.14 or later.


## Adding and Running the Tasks
 
1. Add the task to your build job.

2. Specify the Report location pattern. You can also enable the 'Pick up test results that were created outside of this build' option in the Advanced settings (optional).

3. Run a build plan and view test results in the test tab.


## Viewing Results

After running the tasks, results will be available in the project plan home page.

You can drill-down into the Test results page for additional information
